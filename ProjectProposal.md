###Final Project Proposal: Ecquo Group (Hans, Abass, Joshelyn)

###Problem: 

Personal management and lifestyle management can be challenging (Trust us on this one). Most of us underestimate the importance of planning, prioritizing, and staying on top of important life objectives whether it be our health, finance, family, professional development, etc. The goal of this app is to help users maximize time and energy, while boosting productivity. Our intended user is anyone looking to better manage their life. 

Time and energy are our only resources, 
and productivity is our only happiness.

This app is meant to help users get better organized, and stick to goals and long-term commitments. This mission to help people grow, monitor (and build new) habits/trends will be strengthened by key metrics being recorded by the app.


###Solution: 

The secret to changing yourself, improving conditions, and bettering your life is doing it one day at a time.

One day at a time: Staying on top of your goals, unlearning bad habits is really more about making incremental changes EVERY DAY.
would allow users to divide ongoing life management focuses, which consist of Action Steps, Resources, and Backburner items. 
Every day, conquer action steps, record your progress, and target growth areas.

###Execution: 

The app will consists of two features, a simplified Day View to-do list that is restored to a clean slate every day, forcing users to specify which elements of varying goals must be attended to for that day

Additional Features:
-Reorder and reprioritizing daily objectives (UI)
-Location-based reminders. Ex: Office tasks are suggestions when office location is   detected.

-Backburner: 
Pomodoro feature.
	



How does this differ from other organizer/note-taking apps? : 
Simplicity: Life’s goals and objectives will amass. You need an organizer tool for today with only the relevant
Metrics: Little nudges can be really useful in getting a user back on track. EX: Prompt user to select fewer priority target goals if the user’s metrics report that they’ve been a little “overambitious” in their original planning. 

###TIMELINE:

By August 14th: First Sprint
