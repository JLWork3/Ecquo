## Weekly Retro Template  

**Goals for last Sprint**: Have object oriented model set-up

**Goals for this Sprint**: Catch up on oop set up, clarify the user experience and purpose of app (meet and go through this in detail)

**Guiding Questions** (consider before the meeting):

  *  What went well? Got a functional logo, and a basic UI as a starting point.
  *  What should we do differently next time? Be really clear about what the app will do before going forward
  *  What did we learn? About material design, navigation drawer, and some animations
  *  What still puzzles us? How exactly to present all of the different information throughout the app.
 
**Team Member Analysis**:
If you did not meet your goals, how will this affect the progression of the product? What will you do differently to meet your goals this week?
