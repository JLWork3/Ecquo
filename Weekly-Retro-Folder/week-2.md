        * Did you meet your goals/responsibilities last week? Why or why not? Sort of. I got the to-do list to work but when I tried to merge it, it got difficult. Also the conflicts of work messes up my time to focus on the project. 
    * Goals/Responsibilities This Week: Set up or organize our Activity Flow and research/work on the Animation. Also searching for ways to get the todo to be on the card

**Additional Discussion Topics**:

  *  Compare your work planned with what your work completed. Nowhere near as much as I thought I would get done.
  *  Is the divison of roles within your team working? Still unstable
  *  How is communication and collaboration between team members? Rough around the edges.
  *  Are you getting adequate support? How are you reviewing code? Yes, more communication will make it go longer. Clarity in explaining what each person is doing. Be on the same page with what we want to accomplish. More compromises.
  *  How can you improve productivity and get the most work done within the next week?    Don't sleep! (jk). Work hard, and check in with teammates.
